# GitHub GraphQL Relay Modern Example

This project was created to demonstrates how to use [Relay Modern](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/relay-modern.html) to build a simple users listing web view against the GitHub GraphQL API.

## Running locally

### First, create a GitHub API access token

First, you'll need a GitHub API access token to make GraphQL API requests. You can get that [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

### Install

Run the install command to install all dependencies.

```
yarn install
```
### Run

To run the project, you must have created the api access token. While executing `yarn start` you will be asked to type the token.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jvcjunior/react-relay-modern-github
$ cd react-relay-modern-github/
$ yarn start
```

Once your server is running, you can open http://localhost:3000.
