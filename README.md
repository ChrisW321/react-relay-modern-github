# GitHub GraphQL Relay example application

Demonstrates how to use [Relay Modern](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/relay-modern.html) to build a simple repository listing web view against the GitHub GraphQL API.


### Running locally

First, you'll need a GitHub API access token to make GraphQL API requests. You can get that [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jvcjunior/react-relay-modern-github
$ cd react-relay-modern-github/
$ yarn start
```

Once your server is running, you can open http://localhost:3000.
